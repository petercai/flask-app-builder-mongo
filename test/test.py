    # The MongoEngine class is a wrapper around the PyMongo library, which provides a more Pythonic way of interacting
    # with MongoDB databases.
    # By passing the app object to the MongoEngine constructor,
    # it allows MongoEngine to access the application's configuration settings,
    # such as the MongoDB connection URI.
    db = MongoEngine(app)
    #  In Flask, it's common to use context managers or generators to create and manage resources (like database connections)
    #  that need to be initialized and torn down for each request.
    #  When this code is executed, it yields the db object,
    #  which is the initialized MongoEngine instance.
    #  This allows the caller (likely a Flask view function or a blueprint) to use the db
    #  object to interact with the MongoDB database within the context of the current request.
    #
    # After the caller is done using the db object, the context manager or generator function will be responsible for
    #  cleaning up or closing the database connection, if necessary.
